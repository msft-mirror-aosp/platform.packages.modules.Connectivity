# Some connectivity tests run on older OS versions, and for those tests, many
# library dependencies (such as libbase and libc++) need to be linked
# statically. The tests also need to be linked with a version script to ensure
# that the statically-linked library isn't exported from the executable, where
# it would override the shared libraries that the OS itself uses. See
# b/333438055 for an example of what goes wrong when libc++ is partially
# exported from an executable.
