# Classes used by tethering as a hidden API are compiled as a lib in target
# connectivity-internal-api-util. Because it's used by tethering, it can't
# be jarjared. Classes in android.net.connectivity are exempt from being
# listed here because they are already in the target package and as such
# are already not jarjared.
# Because Tethering can be installed on R without Connectivity, any use
# of these classes must be protected by a check for >= S SDK.
